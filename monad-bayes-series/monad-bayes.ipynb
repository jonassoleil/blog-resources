    "The model is parameterized by a boolean `b`, and in this simple case, `b` is also directly the model output.\n",

    "In other words, we get the model parameter `b` from a discrete uniform [prior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability) distribution.\n",

    "Notice the new typeclass `MonadInfer` that allows us to use `score` in addition to sampling.\n",
    "Instead of a single operation, the model is now a chain of actions: _sample_, _score_, â€¦\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a naive idea of how this could work:\n",
    "assume that the representation of the probability distribution of `b` was a list of tuples `[(0.5, True), (0.5, False)]`.\n",
    "We would multiply this distribution with the distribution of my observation \"Yes, it did rain yesterday!\", that is with `[(1, True), (0, False)]`.\n",
    "Then we would normalize the updated probabilities such that they sum to one, and the job is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "So are we secretly tracking the probability of all samplesâ€”the full distributionâ€”at every step (in the Haskell world a.k.a. some variant of the [_Dist_ monad](http://www.randomhacks.net/files/build-your-own-probability-monads.pdf))?\n",
    "Granted, in the case of a `True`/`False` question this might be a good approachâ€”_but this is not what is happening here for very good reasons_:\n",
    "\n",
    "To update a sample's probability as described above we need to track all samples with their probabilities and run global normalization operations on them.\n",
    "We are essentially running computations with full distributions over all possible values.\n",
    "This quickly becomes intractable because a model can basically be any Haskell function with lots and lots of possible outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "`monad-bayes` and similar probabilistic frameworks use an elegant approach that do what we want _without dragging around full distributions_.\n",
    "The trick behind is to approximate the outcome distribution by drawing successive samples from it.\n",
    "It turns out that it is enough to know the _relative probability_ of two samples at a time to do this.\n",
    "The relative probability of the two samples is independent of the probability of other samplesâ€”computations on full distributions are thus reduced to computations on samples.\n",
    "With appropriate sampling algorithms ([MCMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo)) we can approximate the outcome distribution despite this limited knowledge.\n",
    "It is difficult to overstate the implications:\n",
    "with MCMC we can address all kinds of sampling related problems in a probabilistic manner that would be completely inaccessible otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get back to the `score` function that modifies the probability to pull a certain sample from the distribution.\n",
    "We now understand that it multiplies the _relative probability_ to observe a sample compared to any other with a factor.\n",
    "This means that the sample's probability is left untouched if this factor is `1`.\n",
    "If this factor is `10`, the sample's relative probability is increased ten fold with respect to any other sample.\n",
    "If this factor is `0`, the sample's probability is set to `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is `model2` expressed in words: (a) draw a sample from `[True, False]` with equal probability,\n",
    "and (b) multiply the relative probability of a sample with value `True` with `1` and of a sample with value `False` with `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "An appropriate sampler can trace and accumulate the score factor of a sample to compare with the score factor of other samples.\n",
    "The accumulated score factors give us access to the relative probability of the two samples, and then we can use MCMC to start sampling.\n",
    "We won't go into detail here about how tracing and accumulating works or which two samples we are actually comparing.\n",
    "`monad-bayes` provides a few samplers that can go through this process in different ways.\n",
    "We include here the `prior` and the `mh` ([Metropolis-Hastings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis%E2%80%93Hastings_algorithm) sampler) functions before our well known `sampleIOfixed` function to use an MCMC sampler.\n",

    "We learned that the model setup takes only a few lines of code, that is the implementation of `Data`, `Params`, and `likelihood` plus the definition of `prior` and `posterior`.\n",
    "With these initial definitions, the composability of Haskell functions allows us to rapidly get new distributions like `samplingDistribution` or a `predDist`.\n",
    "Involved and with big implications is the sampling process, the choice of the sampling technique, and how it is adapted to the current situation.\n",
    "To sample, we used Metropolis-Hastings and rejection sampling but many other sampling strategies exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope you enjoyed this second post in our Probabilistic Programming with monadâ€‘bayes Series and learned lots! A central aspect of `monad-bayes` is to enable the modeller to use and compose different sampling techniques for their models. Now, you're ready to start getting into such questions in our next post. We hope you join us!"
