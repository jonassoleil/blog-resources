# Extra resources for Tweag's blog posts

This repository contains extra resources like code, Nix shell files and Jupyter notebooks that are useful for reproducing posts from [Tweag's blog](https://www.tweag.io/blog).

The repository is structured as folders whose name is the same as the blog post file.
That is, the blog post `tweag.io/posts/2019-01-01-my-blog-post` will have a corresponding `2019-01-01-my-blog-post` folder with the desired files.
